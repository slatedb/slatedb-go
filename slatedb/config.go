	// How frequently to flush the write-ahead log to object storage (in
	// milliseconds).
	//
	// When setting this configuration, users must consider:
	//
	// * **Latency**: The higher the flush interval, the longer it will take for
	//   writes to be committed to object storage. Writers blocking on `put` calls
	//   will wait longer for the write. Readers reading committed writes will also
	//   see data later.
	// * **API cost**: The lower the flush interval, the more frequently PUT calls
	//   will be made to object storage. This can increase your object storage costs.
	//
	// We recommend setting this value based on your cost and latency tolerance. A
	// 100ms flush interval should result in $130/month in PUT costs on S3 standard.
	//
	// Keep in mind that the flush interval does not include the network latency. A
	// 100ms flush interval will result in a 100ms + the time it takes to send the
	// bytes to object storage.
	FlushInterval time.Duration

	// How frequently to poll for new manifest files. Refreshing the manifest file
	// allows writers to detect fencing operations and allows readers to detect newly
	// compacted data.
	ManifestPollInterval time.Duration

	// Write SSTables with a bloom filter if the number of keys in the SSTable
	// is greater than or equal to this value. Reads on small SSTables might be
	// faster without a bloom filter.
	MinFilterKeys uint32

	// The minimum size a memtable needs to be before it is frozen and flushed to
	// L0 object storage. Writes will still be flushed to the object storage WAL
	// (based on FlushInterval) regardless of this value. Memtable sizes are checked
	// every `FlushInterval` Duration.
	//
	// When setting this configuration, users must consider:
	//
	// * **Recovery time**: The larger the L0 SSTable size threshold, the less
	//   frequently it will be written. As a result, the more recovery data there
	//   will be in the WAL if a process restarts.
	// * **Number of L0 SSTs/SRs**: The smaller the L0 SSTable size threshold, the
	//   more SSTs and Sorted Runs there will be. L0 SSTables are not range
	//   partitioned; each is its own sorted table. Similarly, each Sorted Run also
	//   stores the entire keyspace. As such, reads that don't hit the WAL or memtable
	//   may need to scan all L0 SSTables and Sorted Runs. The more there are, the
	//   slower the scan will be.
	// * **Memory usage**: The larger the L0 SSTable size threshold, the larger the
	//   unflushed in-memory memtable will grow. This shouldn't be a concern for most
	//   workloads, but it's worth considering for workloads with very high L0
	//   SSTable sizes.
	// * **API cost**: Smaller L0 SSTable sizes will result in more frequent writes
	//   to object storage. This can increase your object storage costs.
	// * **Secondary reader latency**: Secondary (non-writer) clients only see L0+
	//   writes; they don't see WAL writes. Thus, the higher the L0 SSTable size, the
	//   less frequently they will be written, and the longer it will take for
	//   secondary readers to see new data.
